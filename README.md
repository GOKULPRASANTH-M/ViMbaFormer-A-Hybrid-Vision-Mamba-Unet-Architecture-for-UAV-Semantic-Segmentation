# ViMbaFormer  
## A Hybrid Vision–Mamba U-Net Architecture for UAV Semantic Segmentation

ViMbaFormer is a hybrid semantic segmentation framework designed for high-resolution UAV imagery. It integrates **Vision Transformers**, **Mamba State Space Models**, and a **U-Net–style encoder–decoder** to jointly model global context and fine spatial details with linear-time complexity.

The architecture is tailored for aerial scene understanding, urban analysis, and autonomous UAV applications.

## 🚀 Highlights

- Hybrid CNN + Transformer + Mamba design  
- Visual State Space Blocks (VSSB) for long-range dependency modeling  
- Hybrid Attention (Mamba + Window Attention + Convolution)  
- Adaptive feature fusion decoder with boundary refinement  
- Lightweight and efficient for large UAV images  
- Strong performance on UAVid, UDD6, and SDD benchmarks

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

ViMbaFormer consists of:

### Encoder
- CNN backbone for hierarchical spatial feature extraction  
- Multiple **Visual State Space Blocks (VSSB)** for global receptive fields  

### Bottleneck
- Hybrid attention combining:
  - Mamba selective state spaces (global context)
  - Local window attention
  - Convolutional spatial refinement  

### Decoder
- U-Net style upsampling  
- Adaptive fusion with learnable weights  
- Boundary-aware attention modules  

### Segmentation Head
- Produces pixel-wise class predictions.

This design balances:

- Local texture (CNN)  
- Global dependencies (Mamba + attention)  
- Efficient computation (linear-complexity SSMs)

## 📊 Supported Datasets

- UAVid (8 classes)  
- UDD6 (6 classes)  
- SDD (22 classes)  

### Dataset Format

```text
dataset/
├── images/
└── masks/
```

Images are padded and split into **1024×1024 patches**:

- UAVid → 8 patches / image  
- UDD6 → 6 patches / image  
- SDD → 24 patches / image  

This preserves full spatial information while enabling efficient training.
